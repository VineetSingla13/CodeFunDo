# CodeFunDo
Even if we are so much technically advanced, still we don't have any proper system to make us aware of upcoming natural disasters, we still lack behind in proper management and pevention of disaster.
# Solution
So we are thinking to make an App which will predict the possibilities of extreme weather conditions using Machine Learning and will aware you by sending  you a notification if there is any possibility of extreme weather condition.Also this App will include all Emergency Helpline Numbers and it will also show you the nearby safe places. Initially we are trying to implement it only for few cities. We already have dataset for past 20 years of these cities.
# Dataset
Our dataset consist of various columns like  Haze, Fog, Smoke, Humidity,Tornado etc. With time our dataset will get updated.
For this we are usin various Azure products such as : Machine Learning service,Cognitive Services,Data Lake Analytics,Virtual Machines,App Service,Mobile Apps
